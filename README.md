# **Easy-Build for XBOX Original**

## I plan to slowly start to revise this build environment, what will be the first changes?
- BVT Monitor will be removed to 'streamline' the script and complicate it less.
- (Hopefully, no promises) some specific code changes for the trunk will be applied.
- Removing requirements for the "Complex" patches
- Add documentation of what I currently know about the tree.

I have added a [Release](https://github.com/Empyreal96/easy-build-xbox/releases/tag/1.0.22.06.2021) to archive the current state of the project for if anyone wants to retain the BVT side of the script

## **What is it?**

A tool in testing for compiling xbox code. Easy to Update script.

- Buildable on Windows 7 - 10 x86 and x64 (x64 in testing and will have compile errors)

- Fixed issues with mstools/idw folders incorrectly being set.

- Basic Options for compiling.

- 'Unofficial' binplace scripts for built files, samples and tools.

- Buildable XDK Samples and other isos (needs testing in xemu/xqemu/xbox).

- Xbox SDK Builder

- Buildable BIOS with Biospack (From the Barnabus repack)

## **Overview on how to use**
You will need access to the Xbox trunk and Team Complex's patch. (Xbox tree and CPXXUPD) you can grab the .VHD at the bottom of the page if you want a 'set up' environment

- Have easy-build-xinit.cmd on the ROOT of a drive e.g: D:\easy-build-xinit.cmd

- Open easy-build-xinit.cmd

- Setup the Xbox trunk in your Drive root as specified in easy-build-xinit (VHD users are already set up)

- Let the script apply Team Complex patches (These allow the xbox trunk to be built)

- Once that's done, follow onscreen instructions until Razzle loads

- Type into razzle: easybuild

- (To build chk type "easybuild chk" without quotes)

- You can now build from the Easy-Build mainmenu

- Built binaries will be in %DriveRoot%\xbox\xboxbuilds\\{fre\\chk}\dump

# **What's Updated?**

```
- Sadly Windows XP is currently NOT SUPPORTED by Easy-Build.. When I tested (on a XP x86 SP3 fresh install,) I recieved errors with the cl.exe and c1.dll. Not sure why maybe I needed to install a few updates so this needs looking at.

- Unified 'easy-build-xinit.cmd' for both x86 and amd64
- Added early 'config' support, Now Settings on 'First run', 'CPXXUPD done' and DevKit IPs are stored in an 'easybuild.conf' (In theory it will automatically update any left over files, there may be issues as its in testing)
- Updated info displayed in 'easy-build-xinit.cmd'
- (Main focus for update) Added a 'Developer Kit' menu, this will allow users to interact with their Debug kits with basic activities for now.
- Added 'Yelo Neighborhood v11' as it is a feature for the Devkit menu
- 'xbConsole.cmd' is a pop-out cmd for Easy-Build DevKit Menu
- Added Work aorund fixes for SDK not building when loaded in FRE

Developer Kit Features so far:
*NOTE* This menu is VERY WIP and you may have a few issues, I will work on any that occur after this initial release. You understand the risks when modifying files on the Xbox HDD!

- Transfer files to and from the console
- Update the console with the 4400 XDK Launcher (Requires XDK Launcher of any kind already set up with xbdm.dll)
- Shortcut to install the 4400 XDK
- Pop-out console to run Xbox CLI tools (e.g xbmemdump.exe)
- Reboot the console from Easy-Build
- Launch a debugging session thanks to XBDM.dll and xbWatson.exe
- Launch Yelo Neigborhood for Functions that provides 
```

# Building on x64 Windows

**This will have errors in set parts of the tree, ideally we need to look into a cross compiler as `amd64` wasn't a thing during the time of the compiler**

- Currently Easy-Build can load razzle on an x64 version of Windows, the Kernel (`ntos`) is fully buildable on x64.
- Many things in the tree will be have Syntax errors, issues with inline x86 targeted code and functions causing compiler errors. *(Some DirectX code, MS CRT code and more)*
- Process for building is no different

**NOTES**: I have tried but I can't see an easy way (and a way I know) that will allow a full build on windows Win64 yet.



# **Virtual Build Verification Testing (BVT) Machine**

## Brief Overview

The Virtual BVT Consists of an XEMU fork of your choice (Ideally supporting visor hacked Bioses), BVTMonitor.cmd and any Boot files XEMU Required (Just not BIOS, BVTMonitor is used to test the Source Build Kernels).

It provides *(With a teeny bit of setup)* an almost fully automated process for connecting Easy-Build to BVTMonitor, building the source, and Binplacing the files on the BVT Drive and starting the BVT (XEMU) as soon as the required bios files have been placed!

## BVTMonitor's Capabilities 

- Detect when Easy-Build has Initiated the BVT Session.

- Monitor the BVT Drive for any files placed by Easy-Build.

- Automatically configure XEMU with source-placed files

- Start as soon as everything is placed and configured

- Can work without a VM, connects to a local Network Share

# **XDK Building** (Main Method)

A small discovery I found was that MS decided to switch from the InstallShield style Setup to a custom build tool called `xpacker.exe`, This is the tool they use to pack the XDK, XBSE and other tools.

This build script is located at **`private\setup\xdk\xdkbuild.bat`**

It uses **`xdk.ini`,`xdk.csv`** and **`private\external\sdk`** to configure and build the Setup

- Choose **Build Xbox SDK** from Easy-Build's Main Menu or run `private\setup\xdk\xdkbuild.bat` from a Razzle window



# **XDK Building** (Old Deprecated Method)
**InstallShield Professional 6.2 is required for this**
I have included my currently in progress script to try and build the Xbox SDK. Currently it fails compiling the InstallShield specific XDK Setup scripts.. 

- To run the script, load Easy-Build, drop to Razzle prompt and type **`private\SDK\setup\xsdkbuild.cmd`**

You may encounter issues with **`language Independent Intel 32 Files`** during build, I haven't gotten round to looking at this so if anyone does make progress let me know!

**NOTE** The version of Easy-Build in the VHD is the initial version, **UPDATE EASY-BUILD** simply by dropping the updated files here in place.

# **Previous Updates**

- Actual easybuild.cmd shows correct Razzle Tool Path now, starts xcopybins.cmd as postbuild
```
